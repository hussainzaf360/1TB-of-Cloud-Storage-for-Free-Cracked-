FC6302/iTunes64Setup.exe - iTunes 64 bit Version for Windows 10/11 which is necessary for the
TeraBox to Download.


https://armconverter.com/sideloadly/SideloadlySetup64.exe - Sideloadly App That Allows You to
Download IPA Files on to your iOS device and make it a usable app.


Step 1: Download all three files and setup iTunes first. Try to login with an Apple ID

Step 2: Once that is complete, set up Sideloadly. It will ask for Apple ID and passcode, but it is only for it
to authorize the IPA for the functionality of TeraBox. (It might not yet and it’s okay)

Step 3: Click on the icon in the left of the Sideloadly app that says IPA and find the .ipa file for TeraBox++.

Step 4: Connect your iPhone to your PC using a USB Cable. Click the option for iPhone on the option for
iDevice.

Step 5: Now it will most likely ask for an Apple ID. Put one in.

Step 6: Now it will download successfully. If it doesn’t work, tell me on my discord or snap.

Step 7: Before clicking on the app, go to Settings < General < VPN and Device Management. You should
see your email. Click it and click “Trust Developer” or something similar and follow the prompts your
iPhone says to do.

Step 8: Now you can open the app and have fun.
